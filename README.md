# 🏡 Airbnb Clone

A scalable backend system inspired by Airbnb, built using **Spring Boot**, **JPA/Hibernate**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
This project focuses on clean domain modeling, explicit lifecycle management, and reliable booking foundations, reflecting how real-world hospitality platforms are designed.

The backend is being built incrementally with an emphasis on:
- correctness over shortcuts
- clear separation of lifecycle and availability
- long-term maintainability and extensibility

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to model the core backend foundations of a short-term rental platform, including:

- Property listings and metadata
- Room-based inventory units
- Reusable amenities and media assets
- Date-based availability and pricing
- Clear lifecycle control of listings and rooms

Design decisions prioritize clarity, consistency, and real-world constraints over minimal implementations.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- 🏨 Property (Hotel) management  
- 🛏 Room-based inventory modeling  
- 📍 Embedded address, location, and contact information  
- 🏷 Reusable amenity catalog  
- 🖼 Listing- and room-level photo management  
- 📅 Per-day availability with date-specific pricing  
- 🔁 Explicit lifecycle control using `isActive` flags  

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- Normalize transactional data to ensure correctness  
- Separate **lifecycle state** from **availability state**  
- Embed value objects to reduce unnecessary joins  
- Model availability explicitly to prevent double bookings  
- Favor extensibility over premature optimization  

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- Java 25  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)  
- PostgreSQL  
- Maven

## 🔁 Lifecycle vs Availability

A clear distinction is maintained between **entity lifecycle** and **booking availability**.

### Lifecycle (`isActive`)
- Controls whether an entity participates in the system
- Applies at a coarse-grained level

Examples:
- `Hotel.isActive = false` → listing is hidden and not bookable
- `Room.isActive = false` → room is removed from usable inventory

### Availability (date-based)
- Controls whether a listing or room can be booked on a specific date
- Managed through per-day availability records

Availability does not deactivate entities, and lifecycle flags do not represent bookings.

---

## 📅 Availability Model Overview

Availability is modeled **per date**, rather than as date ranges.

Each availability record answers:
- Can this be booked on this date?
- At what price?
- Is it explicitly blocked?

This design supports:
- Prevention of double bookings
- Date-specific pricing (including seasonal variation)
- Safe concurrent access

The availability calendar acts as the single source of truth for bookings.

## 📊 Project Progress

### ✅ Completed
- Core domain modeling (Hotel, Room, User, Amenity)
- Room-based inventory design
- Explicit lifecycle handling using `isActive`
- Per-day availability schema with pricing
- Separation of lifecycle vs availability concerns
- User roles and authentication-ready user model
- Booking foundation (unit-based booking model)

### 🚧 In Progress
- Booking workflows and transactional consistency
- Availability locking strategy
- Booking status lifecycle (confirm / cancel)

### 🗺 Planned
- Payment integration
- Cancellation and refund rules
- Redis-based caching for availability
- ElasticSearch-powered search
- Event-driven booking flow
- Frontend integration

---

## 🚧 Roadmap

Planned additions include:

- Booking and payment workflows  
- Cancellation policies  
- Redis-based caching  
- ElasticSearch-powered search  
- Event-driven booking flow  

---

## 🔮 Frontend (Planned)

A frontend application will be added in a later phase of this project.

The current focus is on building a robust and well-structured backend, ensuring:
- correct domain modeling
- explicit lifecycle management
- stable availability and booking foundations

Once the backend stabilizes, a frontend (web or mobile) will be introduced to consume the APIs.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 25  
- Maven  
- PostgreSQL  

### Run Locally

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-backend.git
    cd airbnb-backend
    mvn spring-boot:run

Database configuration can be updated in `application.properties`.

---

## 📌 Project Scope

This project is intended to:
- Explore realistic backend design challenges
- Practice clean ORM and schema modeling
- Serve as a foundation for future extensions

It intentionally avoids UI concerns and focuses on backend correctness and structure.

## 📝 Notes

This README is treated as a living document and will evolve alongside the system as new features and architectural components are added.
